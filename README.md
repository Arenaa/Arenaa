Hi there!

:herb: I'm a deep learning researcher passionate about vision-language models, particularly focused on diffusion models for image generation. My research aims to uncover the inner workings of these models to better understand their ability to generate realistic images. I also work on improving evaluation techniques to assess image quality, diversity, and faithfulness. My goal is to enhance the capabilities of generative models by gaining deeper insights into their thinking process.

:notebook: I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on research projects related to these areas. If you're interested in working together or have any questions about my research, please don't hesitate to [get in touch!](khoshnoodi.ma@gmail.com)
