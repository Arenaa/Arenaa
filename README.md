Hi there!

:herb: I'm a deep learning researcher with a diverse background and substantial expertise in reinforcement learning. My passion lies in vision-language models, particularly focusing on diffusion models for image generation. Moreover, I'm actively engaged in exploring innovative ways to merge deep reinforcement learning with diffusion models, aiming to push the boundaries of AI capabilities even further.

:notebook: I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on research projects related to these areas. If you're interested in working together or have any questions about my research, please don't hesitate to [get in touch!](khoshnoodi.ma@gmail.com)
