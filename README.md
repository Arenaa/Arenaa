Hi there!

:herb: I'm a DL researcher with a passion for vision-language models. My current research focuses on different aspects of diffusion models and how they work and how we can evaluate them.

:notebook: I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on research projects related to these areas. If you're interested in working together or have any questions about my research, please don't hesitate to [get in touch!](khoshnoodi.ma@gmail.com)
